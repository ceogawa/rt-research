Initial commit from Briana Kuo's master thesis on ray tracing and light placement for dark scenes.

Credit for DBSCAN Implementaion: GitHub User Eleobert/dbscan (altered to use K-nearest neighbor for varied epsilon selection for objs)

Next Steps: 
-bounding box hierarchy within objects using clusters
-volumetric lighting for god rays/moonbeam simulation
-precision regarding inner outline detection vs outline detection
